This project, the MapServer, is the node code which serves up the map information.

It started with the PresidentsJSON file.
That was the base of this project.  

NOW I need to:

__ Change so that the server is reading/writing lat/long instead of President info.
__ Make a Cordova client application to talk to that server.
__ ????


So change this so it's reading/writing DIFFERENT information. 
Then we will have to have a different sort of client app (see DataUser01)??
